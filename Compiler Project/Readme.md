# C-Compiler


A compiler for a simple language similar to c language. Written in Lex, Yacc, C.


## Compiller has 3 steps:

1. Lexical analysis reuslt will be a Abstract syntax tree for Syntax analysis.
2. Syntax analysis.
3. Three address code (3AC) generation.

# Language description
This manual describes the syntax and (some) semantics of a simple procedural
language. Please note that some of the examples in this description might be
legal syntactically, but are not semantically. You should be mindful of those
cases.

## Lexical Description
### Keywords Lexemes
* bool
* char
* int
* real
* string
* int*
* char*
* real*
* if
* else
* while
* for
* var
* return
* null
* void
* do
### Operator Lexemes
We support the following operators, which follow the operator precedence
table from the language C:
* &&
* /
* =
* ==
* \>
* \>=
* <
* <=
* \-
* !
* !=
* ||
* \+
* \*
* &
### Literal Lexemes

* boolean: "true" or "false"
* char: A character literal is a single, printable character, enclosed in
single quotes.
Examples:
'a' : lowercase a
'A' : uppercase a
"a" : not a character; there are double quotes, and hence, this
is a string
* integers (int): An integer literal can be a decimal or hex.
Examples:
100 : Decimal (cannot start with Zero if it is NOT zero)
0x01F : Hex (any number beginning with 0x or 0X and digits 0-
9,A,B,C,D,E,F)
* reals (similar to double in C language)
Examples: 3.14, -34.9988, 45.3E-23, -4E+2101, +.2E4, 4.e-67
* string: A string is an array of characters. It is written as a sequence of
characters enclosed by double quotes. The closing double quotes must be
on the same line as the opening quotes. That is, they cannot be separated
by a newline. To make things easier, a string cannot contain a double
quote character, since this would terminate the string.
Examples:
"this is a string" : simple string that contains 16
characters
"this is \"invalid\"" : invalid string, double quotes cannot
be escaped
"this is no newline\n" : string that contains 20 characters,
including a backslash and a lowercase n
"" : empty strings are okay

* identifier: An identifier literal can be a variable or function name.
Identifiers must start with an alpha character (upper or lowercase letter),
followed by zero or more digits, "_", and/or other alpha characters.
* pointers: A pointer is a type that points to a value of its base type.

  Technically, a pointer variable stores the memory address of the value
(or the address of the variable) that it points to. An integer/double
pointer can only point to integer/double variables. A char pointer can
point to a char variable, or an element of a string (as a string is nothing
else than an array of characters).

  There are two operators that are only valid for pointers. One is the
dereference operator (using the '*' character). The dereference operator
allows us to directly access the variable that the pointer references (that
is, the variable that it points to). The second operator that can be used in
connection with pointers is the address of operator (using the '&'
character). This operator can only be applied to integer variables, real
variables, character variables, and string (character array) elements. It
takes the address of this variable, and its result can be assigned to a
pointer of the appropriate type.

  Finally, there is a special keyword (token) that represents a pointer that
points nowhere (an empty pointer, or an invalid pointer). This keyword
is null.

  Examples:
```c
var char* x; /* x is a pointer to a character variable */
var int x, z;
var int* y;
x = 5;
y = &x; /* We take the address of x and assign it to y.
 As a result, y points to x, which is 5. */
x = 6; /* y still points to x, which is 6 now */
z = *y; /* Dereference y, and assign to z the value that y
 points to (which is 6). */
y = null; /* y is now the NULL pointer */
z = **y; /* illegal; you can only use a dereference operation
once */
&x = y; /* illegal; cannot use the address operato
```

## Description of Program Structure

### Comments
Comments in this language are block comments (C-style). The form is:
/* comments */

#### Correct (legal): 
/* this is my
comment */

#### Incorrect (illegal):
// wrong language 


## Programs 
A program is composed of many functions, just listed one after another. Every
legal program should have one and only one procedure: 'main()'. This is case
sensitive, so Main() is incorrect. Of course, a program can have user defined
functions too. Any function must be defined before the point of call

### Correct (legal):
```c
int foo(){
 return 0;
}
void main()
{
 var int a;
 a = foo();
}
```
### Incorrect (illegal): foo is used before it is declared
```c
void main()
{
 var int a;
 a = foo();
}
int foo(){
 return 0;
}
````

## Functions

### Functions are declared as:

```c
type id "(" parameter_list ")" "{" body "}"

                    or

void id "(" parameter_list ")" "{" body "}"
```

Note the placement of the "()" and "{}" symbols. These must go exactly
there. id is the name of the function. Read below for more
details. parameter_list are the parameters you have declared for the function.
This list can be empty. The types of the function arguments must be
either ``` bool, char, int, real, char*, real*, or int*.``` type is the type of the return
value of the function and must be either bool, void, char, int,
```real, char*,real*, or int*.``` body contains function declarations, variable
declarations, and statements.

You may declare one or more functions inside the body of a function, thus,
nested functions are possible with this language. In the case the return type of 
the function is not void, the last statement in a function must be a return
statement, and it can also appear anywhere within a code block.

### Correct (legal):
```c
int foo(int i, j, k)
{
  bool fee(int l, m, n; real x, y)
  {
    return true;
  }
  return 0;
}
void goo(int i, j, k)
{
  bool fee(int l, m, n)
  {
    return true;
  }
  fee(2,3,4);
}
```

The id can be any string starting with an alpha character (upper or lowercase
letter) and can contains digits, "_", or other alpha characters.

### Correct (legal):
```c
int foo() { return 0; }
int foo_2() { return 0; }
void f234() { }
```

### Incorrect (illegal):
```c
int 9foo() { return 0; }
int _rip() { return 0; }
```
A parameter_list: you can pass multiple types of variables, and as many
variables as you want. However, you must list the same variable types together
and separate them with a comma. You must separate different types with a
semicolon. The correct syntax is as follows:

``` 
"(" TYPE1 IDA_0 "," ... "," IDA_N ";" TYPE2 IDB_0 "," ... "," IDB_N ";" ... ")" 
```

Notice that the last type does not have a semicolon after it. If you only pass in
one type of variable, you would not need to have a semicolon and putting one
in should produce an error.

### Correct (legal):
```c
int foo(int i, j, k; bool l, m, n) { return 0; }
void fee(int a, b) { }
int fei(int a, b, c; bool d, e, f; int g, h) { return 0; }
```
### Incorrect (illegal):
```c
void foo(i, j, k) { } /* no type defined */
void foo(int i j k) { } /* IDs must be separated by comma */
```
### Body
The body can contain nested function declarations, variable declarations, and
statements after all declarations. This makes our language very much like C,
because you must declare everything first.

### Correct (legal):
```c
int foo(int i, j, k)
{
 int square(int t) /* func declarations */
 {
 var int temp;
 temp = t*t;
 return 0;
 }
 var int total; /* variable declarations */
 total = 1; /* statements */
 return total;
}
```

### Variable Declarations
Variables are declared in the following syntax:

```"var" TYPE ID1 "," ID2 "," ID3 "," ... "," IDN ";"``` 

Variables may be assigned in the declaration
### Correct (legal):
```c 
var int i = 0;
var bool m = true, n = false, x;
var char c = ‘a’;
```
### Strings (character arrays)
Arrays are declared with the following syntax:
```
"string" ID1 "[" INTEGER_LITERAL "]" "," ID2 "[" INTEGER_LITERAL "]"
"," ... "," IDN "[" INTEGER_LITERAL "]" ";"
```
Strings can be assigned as a normal variable. You can also assign string literals
to string variables. Individual string elements can be assigned character values,
or they can be used as part of an expression. Their indexing element is also an
expression. By using the bar |s|, one can compute the length of the string as it
was declared.
### Correct (legal):
```c
string a[30], b[100] = “moshe”;
var char c;
var int i;
c = 'e';
a[19] = 'f';
a[4+2] = 'g';
b = a;
b[3] = c;
a = "test"; /* basically equivalent to a[0] = 't'; a[1] = 'e'; a[2] =
's'; a[3] = 't'; a[4] = '\0'; */
i = |b|; /* this assigns 100 to variable i, since the length
operator returns the size of the character array */
```

Essentially, a string element is exactly like a character type and the string
variable itself is simply a new type. The following are not legal uses of strings:

### Incorrect (illegal):
```c
string a[30], b[100] = “moshe”;
var char c;
c = 'e'; /* everything up to this is OK */
c = a; /* type mismatch, can't assign string type to character type */
(a + 4)[0] = 'e';
 /* cannot add anything to array elements - they are not pointers */
```
### Statements
Statements can be many things: an assignment statement, a function
call statement, an if statement, an if-else statement, a while statement, a code
block, etc.

The syntax for an assignment statement is:
```
lhs "=" expression ";"
lhs "=" STRING_LITERAL ";"
```
Here, lhs -- which stands for left-hand side (of the assignment) -- specifies all
legal targets of assignments. Specifically, our grammar accepts three different
lhs items:
```
 x = expr; /* lhs is variable identifier */
 str[expr] = expr; /* lhs is string element */
 *ptr = expr; /* lhs is dereferenced pointer */
```
We cannot assign values to arbitrary expressions. After all, what sense would
make a statement such as

``` 
(5+2) = x; 
```

Thus, we have to limit the possible elements that can appear on the left-hand
side of the assignment as discussed above.
The right-hand side of assignments is less restrictive. It includes expressions, as
well as string literals (we have to mention string literals explicitly, since strictly
speaking, they are not expressions).
A code block starts with a "{" and ends with a "}". It may contain variable
declarations and statements (again, in this specific order). Both variable
declarations and statements are optional. Thus, a code block can be empty. Of
course, since a code block is a statement, code blocks can be nested within code
blocks.
### Correct (legal):
```c
int foo()
{
 var int x;
 {
 var int y;
 x = 1;
 y = 2;
 {
 x = 2;
 }
 y = 3;
 }
 return 0;
}
int foo()
{
 {
 {} /* empty code blocks are okay, although not very useful */
 }
 return 0;
}
```
### Incorrect (illegal):
```c
int foo()
{
 var int x;
 {
 x = 1;
 var int y;
/* must declare all variables before any statement */
 }
 return 0;
}
```
The syntax for a function call statement is:
```c
lhs "=" function_id "(" expression0 "," expression1 "," ... expressionN ")" ";"

                            or

function_id "(" expression0 "," expression1 "," ... expressionN ")" ";"
```


The syntax for if, if/else, for and while statements is shown below.
```c
"if" "(" expression ")" "{" body_of_nested_statement "}"
"if" "(" expression ")" statement;
"if" "(" expression ")" "{" body_of_nested_statement "}" 
"else" "{" body_of_nested_statement "}"
"if" "(" expression ")" statement; "else" statement;

"while" "(" expression ")" "{" body_of_nested_statement "}"
"while" "(" expression ")" statement;
"do" "{" body_of_nested_statement "}" "while" "(" expression ")" ";"
"for" "(" init ";" expression ";" update ")"
"{" body_of_nested_statement "}"
"for" "(" init ";" expression ";" update ")" statement;

```

Here, body_of_nested_statement is similar to a code block, in that it may
contain variable declarations and statements (in this specific order). The body
of a nested statement can be empty.
init – simple assignment of constant int value into int variable. For example:

```x = 0```

update - assignment of expression into int variable. For example:

```x = x + 1```

```x = a+b*c```

#### Return Statement
The last statement in non-void function must be a return statement. The syntax
for the return statement is:

```return expression;```

### Correct (legal):
```c
int foo() { return 0; }
int foo_2() { var int a; a = 2; return a; }
int foo_3() { if (true) { return foo(); } return 0; }
void foo_4() { var int a; a = 2; }
```
### Incorrect (illegal):
```c
int foo_3() {return true; }
int foo_3() {if (true) {return 0;} }
void foo_4() { return 0; }
```

### Expressions
```
An expression's syntax is as follows:
expression operator expression
 OR
operator expression
```
Operators have the same precedence as in C/C++.

Expressions

### Correct (legal):
```c
3 || 2
(3 + 2) / 3 - 5 * 2
true && false || false
a > b || !(b == c)
5
3.234
true
-5
*x
*(p+5)
!false
a >= b
```

## Function Call
### Correct (legal):
```c
a = foo(i, j); /* 'a' has been declared already */
foo(goo(a,5),8,hoo())
```
## if/else/while statements

### Correct (legal):
```c 
if(3 > 2)
{
 /*...statements...*/
 i = 5; /* i has been declared above */
}
```
/* more examples … */
```c
if(true) { j = 3; } else { k = 4; }
while(k<100) { l = 2; k = l + j; }
if(a<max && foo()==7) i = 5;
if(true) { j = 3; } else x = x-1;
while(false) x = x + 1;
for (i=0; i<10; i=i+2){ a = a + i;}
do {a = a + i; i= i + 1;} while (i<=10);
```
## Pointers
Note that pointers require some special attention: you cannot take the address
of just any expression. This is the case because an expression might not
actually have a memory address where it is stored. For instance, &(5+3) is
undefined, because the result 8 does not have to be stored in memory but could
be stored in a register instead.

Therefore, we are allowing the use of the address of operator (&) only on
variable identifiers and string (character array) elements. When you take the
address of a variable, you can use the result in an expression. However, you
cannot take the address of an arbitrary expression.

When taking the address of a string, indexing is required (&string is illegal,
but &string[0] is legal). Note that the type of &string[0] is char*.

Our language also supports some pointer arithmetic for char pointers: you can
add and subtract from a pointer. If you add or subtract to a char pointer, then
you should advance to the next or previous character respectively. We do not
support pointer arithmetic for pointers to integer. Also, you cannot multiply a
pointer with a value or a variable. When you add the result of an expression to
a char* (or subtract an expression from a char*), the resulting type is still
a char*.


```null``` assigns a value of 0 to a pointer. Note that this is very different from
assigning the value 0 to an integer that an int* might reference! Instead, it
means that the pointer does not point to any legal variable / value. When you
dereference the null pointer, the result is undefined, and your program likely
crashes (with a null pointer exception).

You can compare two pointers. In this case, you don't compare the values that
the pointers reference. Instead, you compare the memory addresses that they
point to. When two pointers reference the same variable (the same memory
location), then a comparison operation yields true, false otherwise. You can
also compare a pointer with null to check if it is valid.

### Correct (legal):
```c
var int x;
var int* y;
x = 5;
y = &x;
x = 6;
var char* x;
string y[10];
var char z;
y = "foobar";
x = &y[5]; /* x points to 'r' */
z = *(x - 5); /* z is 'f' */
y = "barfoo"; /* z is still 'f', but x now points to 'o' */
```
### Incorrect (illegal):
```c
var bool* x; /* no such pointer type */
x = &(1+3);
var char x;
var int* y;
y = &x; /* address of x is of type char* */
var char* x;
var char y;
x = &(&y);
/* can only take the address of variable or array element, and (&y) is
an expression */
```
